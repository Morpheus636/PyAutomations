# Usage
## Environment variables
None as of this moment, but they will be coming.

## Running Locally
After setting up your environment, run the main script with `poetry shell && python -m src.morphtomations `

## Deploying in Repl.it
Just press the Run button at the top of the page. Make sure you set up an uptimerobot monitor pointing at the keep-alive
url to make sure repl.it doesn't shut down the instance.
